# 🎲 CeeloDice v2 (React Native Version)

A mobile dice game based on the street game _Cee-lo_, built with **React Native** and **TypeScript**.

> I designed and developed this game as an effort to adapt Ceelo Dice into a video game. As part of this process, I developed the game in a variety of different languages, starting in C# on Unity, before writing the game in both React Native and React.
